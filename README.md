# Confidence Intervals
Long story short, a conficence interval is our best guess for a parameter using the data that we got from out sample. For example, imagine that we are trying to figure out the average length of a french fry out of a Rally's drive-in, and suppose that a partiular random sample from the nearest Rally's yields that $\bar{x}=13.7$ inches.
